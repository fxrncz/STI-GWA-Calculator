# STI-GWA-Calculator
I created a small project using Java Swing Framework. This application calculates a General Weighted Average (GWA) of a student. The maximum panel that you can add is 10 panels.
If you want to run the program/application, you can install the application by going to my repositories and open the "Executable-Applications".
